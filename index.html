								<p>Hello! My name is Aarya Atluri and I am a computer engineering student at The Univeristy of Texas at Austin expecting to graduate December 2023. I really enjoy rock climbing, playing video games, reading, and listening to music. I mostly read fiction and listen to older rap music. I also love watching basketball and my favorite players are Kobe, Rose, Luka, and Lebron(MJ is terrible btw).<br><br>P.S. If you are a Recruiter at LinkedIn looking at this website, I just want to let you know that I love LinkedIn and would love to work for you.</p>
